# Project - Data Visualized

The purpose of the project is for you to demonstrate your ability to copy and manipulate a Bootstrap template created by someone else.

I recommend you use one of the themes available under the "Templates" section of the [w3schools Bootstrap Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp).

##Step 1

Clone this repository into your Cloud9 workspace.

##Step 2

Choose a template from the w3schools options, or if you want to try some other themes, look at [https://startbootstrap.com/](https://startbootstrap.com/).   Make sure to choose a "Landing Page" or "One Page Website" template.

##Step 3

Download the source file(s), then upload them into the Cloud9 directory that was created in step 1.   (You can upload an entire folder to Cloud9.)

##Step 4

Edit the template to replace all the default content (text, images, map location, etc.) with your own content.   You'll probably have to spend some time "inspect"-ing elements using the Dev Tools to start understanding where any given display element is defined in the template.   


##Step 5

Make sure to use the git commands to add and commit your files.



##Comments and Hints

I expect you to run into problems, but they should easy to fix once you understand the issue.   Don't fight for too long on your own before you post questions on Piazza.

Cloud9 lets you view Revision History;  the option is under the "File" menu option.
