# Project - Data Visualized

The purpose of the project is for you to demonstrate your ability to retrieve data via an API; accept user input to create filter conditions; and visualize the data for the user.  This could be as elements in a Bootstrap layout (similar to our in-class lab), a Google Map, a Google Chart or D3 Chart.


Your page (app) should display some instructions, the user should make some filtering choices, and your script should retrieve data via the API and output the results.



##Step 1

Clone this repository into your Cloud9 workspace.

##Step 2

Choose some data (other than data we've worked with in class), and familiarize yourself with the API.  Learn what data will be returned and how to pass parameters to filter the results.  Practice some basic code examples.

##Step 3

Determine your page design;  use some existing Bootstrap template where appropriate.  Where and how will users input their filter conditions?   How will the results be displayed?  

##Step 4

Code a little, test a little.   Repeat.


##Step 5

Make sure to use the git commands to add and commit your index.html file (and any others.)



##Comments and Hints

I expect you to run into problems, but they should be easy to fix once you understand the issue.   Don't fight for too long on your own before you post questions on Piazza.

Cloud9 lets you view Revision History;  the option is under the "File" menu option.
